GoBar!
------

This is a simple go panel type thing, it features a way to launch apps, interact with running apps, and provides some basic system status.


Config!?
========

To Generate a config just run 

	> go get github.com/AmandaCameron/gobar/gen-bar-config
	> gen-bar-config >~/.config/gobar/config.wini

You may have to edit the generated config after, depending on weather it could find the fonts.
